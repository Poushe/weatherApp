* Select City with country name
* For this project, I used Google Place API to select a city. Based on Google Place API there are some issues like just the USA data contains [state] data but not accurately. That's why I ignore it. Just select the city and country name.
* URL pattern is important to fetch data from API so I used a URL that contains city and country as parameters. so the user has to select the city name with the country name.
* In this example data there is one icon/image used in API. I showed that data on my project as Forecast.
* If someone selects a duplicate city name shows the popular city data. Ex: London,UK. London, Ontario, Canada. In that case, it shows London, UK data.
